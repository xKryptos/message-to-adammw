Hey! I didn't know how else to contact you as the email on your page was wonky, but I was wondering if you could help me fix a Discord bot that works with node-spotify-web. Now I know you were the one who found the fix for the captcha bypass via using Facebook OAuths (not sure.) I'm no good programmer, but at least I try my best and I think I've hit my limits with this issue as I am new to coding both python and Node, which a majority of bots are built on. If you could help me out and point me in the right direction on how to fix the errors I keep on getting and fix the bot, it would be greatly appreciated!
I'm just kind of frustrated because as you can see by my github history (if that's a thing,) for the past few days I've been trying to fix this error but it's brickwall after brickwall and after a while you start to get a bit fatigued.

https://github.com/xKryptos/node-discordbot < this is my fork of the bot.

https://github.com/Laberbear/node-discordbot/issues/3 < the issue I seem to be facing.

After putting in the updated spotify.js you can see in my fork, I get this error when running it: http://i.imgur.com/bhLgSh1.png (currently running Debian as an OS, might that be the reason) let me know if you can help.
